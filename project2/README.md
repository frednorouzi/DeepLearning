# DLND Project2 Image Classification

## Getting started
This project runs on [floydhub](http://floydhub.com/)

To get started, first setup and login to your floyd account.

Next, create a project and get an instance up and running with the following commands.
```
floyd init project2
floyd run --gpu --mode jupyter --env tensorflow-1.0 --data diSgciLH4WA7HpcHNasP9j 
```

NOTE: running a jupyter notebook can take a few minutes; please be patient.  If you need any help, please refer to the floydhub [docs](http://docs.floydhub.com/).
